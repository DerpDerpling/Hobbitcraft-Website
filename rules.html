            <h1>Minecraft Server Rules</h1>
            <h4><small>If you do not follow the rules stated below, us admins reserve the right to punish you according to the punishments section <a href="#punishments">here</a></small></h4>
            <p>If you have any questions about the rules/punishments, please feel free to contact one of the Admins</p>
            <h3>Rule 1</h3>
            <p>Do not grief or steal. Taking items from a chest you don’t own or breaking a building you didn’t build is illegal, unless the owner of the chest/build agrees to it. This includes farms: using someone’s farm without their permission is not allowed. As long as they are done in good taste, pranking someone’s base/build is allowed, but the cleanup process of the prank should definitely take less than an hour.</p>
            <h3>Rule 2</h3>
            <p>Pvp is not illegal, but it’s only accepted in moderation. Killing someone continuously without their consent is illegal. Unless agreed upon differently by the involved parties, all items dropped need to be returned to their owner (this does not include the head drop that happens when a player kills a player). If a player attacks you and you kill them in self defense that’s also allowed.</p>
            <h3>Rule 2.1</h3>
            <p>In case the victim loses their items because of how the attacker killed them (e.x. multiple explosions or lava) the attacker has to use his own resources to get back/farm back the victim's item. This does not jump into effect if the attacker loses its items because the victim used self defense. This is a risk the attacker needs to take.</p>
            <h3>Rule 3</h3>
            <p>Do not xray or cheat. Please do not use hacked/modded clients that give you an advantage over other players. Using tnt dupers, bedrock breakers or similar exploits is accepted however. Straight up ITEM DUPERS ARE NOT ALLOWED (ex. Exploits that can duplicate shulkers of items).</p>
            <h3>Rule 3.1</h3>
            <p>The clay patch trick counts as Xraying/Cheating, using it will result in the same punishment as Xraying</p>
            <hr>
            <div id="punishments">
                <h1>Punishments</h1>
            </div>
            <p>This guide informs you how you will be punished based on how you break the rules on the minecraft server.</p>
            <h3>Xray</h3>
            <p>If we suspect that you have xrayed, we will confront you about it, if you lie, it will only make your punishment worse. If amount xrayed is small and you admit, 1 Week Ban. If you lie about xraying, Permanent Ban</p>
            <h3>Light Griefing</h3>
            <p>Referring to cases where the griefed area is small and of little value - Banned for 3-7 days, Expected to fix griefed area or rolled back</p>
            <h3>Heavy Griefing</h3>
            <p>Using explosives or other tools to damage a major area of high value - Permanent Ban, Area will be rolled back</p>
            <h3>Duping</h3>
            <p>Any form of intended item duping (does not include TNT or entity dupes that benefit you in any way) - Permanent Ban, Duped items deleted</p>
            <h3>Stealing</h3>
            <p>Stealing items or mobs (this includes not giving back a player's items after pvp, excluding heads)- Warn if items are not given back, Permanent Ban in every other case, items need to be given back to their owner in all cases</p>
            <h3>Repeated Killing of a Person</h3>
            <p>When one person is killed multiple times in a short amount of time without their consent - Warn, If they don't stop after warning, and it escalates even further, they get a 3 day Ban.</p>
            <h3>Major Cheating</h3>
            <p>Includes hacked clients, fly hacks, kill aura and similar - Permanent Ban</p>
            <p><small>Ignorance of the rules or punishments is not an excuse. Us admins have full permission to permanently ban you from the minecraft server for breaking the rules.</small></p>
